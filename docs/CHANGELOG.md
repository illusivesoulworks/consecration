### Changed
- Updated to Minecraft 1.18.2

- Changed enchantment name from "Shadow Protection" to "Undead Protection"
- All holy sources except for `holyDamage` and `holyMaterials` have been moved from configs to tags. Tagging anything as
`consecration:holy` will identify the object as holy for the purposes of Consecration
- Undead types have been moved from configs to tags. Tagging an entity as `consecration:undead` will mark it as an
undead. The tags `consecration:fire_resistant`, `consecration:holy_resistant`, and `consecration:resistant` mark undead
and additionally make them resistant from fire, holy, and both respectively
